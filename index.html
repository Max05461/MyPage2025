    <h1>Name: Krit Lokbow</h1>
    <h2>NickName: Max</h2>
    <h2>Field of study: CAI</h2>
    <h2>Section: 1.2-1</h2>
    <br>
    <p>I want to study full-stack web development to gain diverse skills as a developer and build a well-rounded skill set.</p>
    <p>I expect this course will help me learn web development skills with HTML and enable me to build websites. At the same time, I know I need to push myself to keep improving continuously.</p>
    <p>My main weakness that I need to improve is laziness, and I also tend to lose motivation quite easily. My approach to overcoming this is to constantly reignite my drive by learning new things, which helps me stay excited and engaged with knowledge.</p>
